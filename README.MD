The Future of Timekeeping. Now.
(Note: Replace the image link above with a screenshot of your stopwatch in action)

Welcome, fellow digital pioneer. You are now standing on the precipice of a timekeeping revolution. You have stumbled upon the source code for the Balls Stopwatch - Proprietary Unreleased Version. This is not a toy. This is not an app. This is an experience.

We've taken the timeless elegance of "echo" and combined it with the raw, untamed power of the "sleep" command to create a marvel of modern computing. Forget clunky GUIs and bloated frameworks. We've distilled the very essence of time into its purest form: a single, relentless stream of "balls."

Features (Proprietary & Unreleased)
Atomic Timers: Our state-of-the-art sleep 1 command guarantees an approximate one-second delay, give or take a few milliseconds. Time has never been so… approximate!

Sequential Numbering: A meticulously crafted i=$((i+1)) algorithm ensures that each "ball" is numbered sequentially, providing a clear, uninterrupted narrative of your time-tracking journey.

High-Fidelity "Balls" Output: Our echo command delivers a breathtakingly crisp and clear "balls" string directly to your terminal. No compression. No loss of quality. Just pure, unadadulterated "balls."

Infinite Scale: Designed for the modern age, the Balls Stopwatch can count to literally any number you have the patience to watch. The universe is the limit!

Getting Started (If you dare)
To witness this masterpiece in action, simply copy and paste the command below into your terminal. We recommend using a high-performance terminal emulator for the full, immersive experience.

Bash

i=1; while true; do echo "balls $i"; i=$((i+1)); sleep 1; done
Installation
No installation required. We believe in a zero-friction user experience. The code runs directly from your terminal. It's so efficient, it practically installs itself (because it's just one line of code).
