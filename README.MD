Welcome, fellow digital pioneer. You are now standing on the precipice of a timekeeping revolution. You have stumbled upon the source code for the **Balls Stopwatch - Proprietary Unreleased Version**. This is not a toy. This is not an app. This is an experience.

We've taken the timeless elegance of "echo" and combined it with the raw, untamed power of the "sleep" command to create a marvel of modern computing. Forget clunky GUIs and bloated frameworks. We've distilled the very essence of time into its purest form: a single, relentless stream of "balls."

### Features (Proprietary & Unreleased)

* **Atomic Timers:** Our state-of-the-art `sleep 1` command guarantees an approximate one-second delay, give or take a few milliseconds. Time has never been soâ€¦ approximate!
* **Sequential Numbering:** A meticulously crafted `i=$((i+1))` algorithm ensures that each "ball" is numbered sequentially, providing a clear, uninterrupted narrative of your time-tracking journey.
* **High-Fidelity "Balls" Output:** Our `echo` command delivers a breathtakingly crisp and clear "balls" string directly to your terminal. No compression. No loss of quality. Just pure, unadadulterated "balls."
* **Infinite Scale:** Designed for the modern age, the Balls Stopwatch can count to literally any number you have the patience to watch. The universe is the limit!

### Getting Started (If you dare)

To witness this masterpiece in action, simply copy and paste the command below into your terminal. We recommend using a high-performance terminal emulator for the full, immersive experience.
